# caching 


caching is another way to improve your read operations, the general idea is to keep a copy of the data in local memory, and avoid the database round trip.

Hibernate provide us two well know cache level. The *1st level* and the *2nd level*

# 1 st Level Cache

- works at the Hibernate session level, thefore, if we have two diferent sessions we have also two 1sts caches, one for each hibernate session  

- also know as Persistence context

- activated by default

- contains all entities used during the life cicle os the hibernate session


# 2nd Level cache

- Also keep entities, but is independenty of the hibernate session
- All the Hibernate sessions share this cache
- session independent
- requeres additional configurations



## Query Cache

O primeiro e segundo nivel de cache trabalham com entidades. No entanto esta cache trabalha query results.
O Query cache Ã© uma feacture proprietaria do hibernate, e tem por objectivo fazer cache de query results.
session independent
requeres additional configurations

# 1st level 

- activo 

# 2nd level 

store entities, but in deference to the 1en is independent from the session. 
That meand that a Session A can put some instance in the cache, and a other Session B can read it from the cach

- Transparent usage
- Is part of the JPA specification, but the provider implementation don't need to provide it, allow us to choise the implementation that we need to use (eg. ECache or infinispan)
- Hibernate can provide some internal cache but it should not be used in production. it should be used only for test proposes
- If we are using hibernate with the aplication server wildfly or jboss then we should use infinispan
	

- Needs to be activated
	
	- on the persistence.xml or EntityManagerFactory 

		```xml
		<!-- enable selective 2nd level cache in persistence.xml -->
		<shared-cache-mode>ENABLE_SELECTIVE</shared-cache-mode>
		```


- We need to provide the **shared-cache-mode** when we actived the 2nd level cache, this configuration defines with entities should be cached. We can choose 4 different modes: 

  - **ALL**
    
    cache all entities, not recommended 
  
  - **NONE** 
  
    cache no entities, not recommended
  
  - **ENABLE_SELECTIVE**
  
    cache needs to be activated for specific entities
    the most commonly used mode is enable_selected, which allows you to define exactly which entities should be cached. this makes much more sense than to cache everything, because we do not get cache for free, it requires memory to store the entities and CPU time to manager the cache, so to use it we must have absolutely sure that the benefits of having a cached entity are higher than directly accessing the Database. 
    this is only the case when the entity is only read without being changed.
    Entities that are not read from the cache only consumes memory, and if it is necessary to update the caches it will consumes time.
  
  - **DISABLE_SELECTIVE**
  
     cache can be deactivated for specific entities


### When does Hibernate use the 2nd Level Cache?

- for the EntityManager.find(Class, id)
- To traverse relationships
    ```
        Project a = em.find(Project.class, 1L);
        
        // use a getter method to get access related entities
        a.getDevelopers();
    ```
- But not for any query! (JPQL, Criteria, or NativeQuery)

### How is the entity stored in the cache?

- Stores only the entity properties, not the entity itself

    - 1 -> [,"Joshua", "Bloch", 0, , , ... ]  
    
    - Id and a array with values of the properties
    
- Does not store the relations between entities

    - this feacture can be activeted with the annotation: @org.hibernate.annotations.Cache 


### Examples


In persistence.xml

```xml

<shared-cache-mode>ENABLE_SELECTIVE</shared-cache-mode>

<property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class" value="org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory"/>
```

In The entity:

we can use the annotation `@javax.persistence.Cacheable` defined in JPA specification, that activates the cache for the current entity

```java
@Entity
@javax.persistence.Cacheable 
public class Project {
}
```

Or 
If we are using hibernate was JPA provider, we can use use the annotation: `@org.hibernate.annotations.Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL) ` with does the same of the previous annotation
But can be used to find more configurations like CacheConcurrencyStrategy

```java
@Entity
@org.hibernate.annotations.Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL)
public class Project {
}
```


###### What about the caching of relationship?

- By default Hibernate does not cache the relationship between two entities. Even if the two entities are already in the cache.

- This means that even if two related entities have already ben injected in the cache: it is necessary to execute a query to know that that to entities are related.

- This behavior is almost certainly not what we expect to have when we activate the 2 level cache.

- Based in the JPA specification relationships are not cached.

- Fortunately we can improve this behavior, by annotating the entity relationship with the Hibernate specific annotation.
    
```
@Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL)
```
